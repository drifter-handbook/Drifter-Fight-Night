    This repository is not a place of honor... no highly esteemed deed is commemorated here... nothing valued is here.

    What is here was dangerous and repulsive to us. This message is a warning about danger.

    The danger is in a particular location... it increases towards a center... the center of danger is here... of a particular size and shape, and below us.

    The danger is still present, in your time, as it was in ours.

    The danger is to the mind, and it can make big sads.

    The form of the danger is an emanation of bad decisions.

    The danger is unleashed only if you substantially disturb this place physically. This place is best shunned and left uninhabited.
